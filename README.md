# ualberta-lscdiscovery

The UAlberta team at the shared task on Lexical Semantic Change Discovery (LSCDiscovery) in Spanish.
Our approach obtains competitive results.
For phase 1 (graded change discovery), we ensemble static and contextual embeddings.
For phase 2 (binary change detection), we phrase it as a word sense disambiguation problem.
Code for graded change discovery and binary change detection are in the respective folders.
