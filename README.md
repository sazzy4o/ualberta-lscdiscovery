# ualberta-lscdiscovery

The UAlberta team at the shared task on Lexical Semantic Change Discovery (LSCDiscovery) in Spanish, collocated with the 3rd International Workshop on Computational Approaches to Historical Language Change 2022 (LChangeâ€™22).
Our approach obtains competitive results.

For phase 1 (graded change discovery), we ensemble static and contextual embeddings.
For phase 2 (binary change detection), we frame it as a word sense disambiguation problem.
Code for graded change discovery and binary change detection are in the respective folders.
